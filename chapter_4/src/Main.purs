{-
That line: concatMap (\i -> 1 .. n) (1 .. n)
seems like a for-loop in imperative languages.
concatMap, as said before, will flatten the arrays. To see clearer:
Try map (\i -> 1 .. n) (1 .. n) for 3: [[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]
- i is an element from the outer array: (1 .. n).

Note:
Ë†Ë†Ë†Ë†Ë†
map and concatMap are specialization of the more general
map and bind operators. map and concatMap are for array comprehensions
while map and bind are for monad comprehensions. ðŸ’¥

{-
-> take all the numbers from 1 to n
-> filter the primes
-> guard against the product that matches n
-- Coming up next

{-
use factors then on all the pairs,
 find factors on each element on the inner array
 till they are reduced to prime nummers and that should be it.
 Might even need to consider kust [1,n]
